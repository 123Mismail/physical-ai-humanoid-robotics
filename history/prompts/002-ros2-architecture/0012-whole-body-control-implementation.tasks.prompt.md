# Whole-Body Control Implementation for Chapter 12

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
ok great work now go for the next task.
```

## Response Summary (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Successfully created Chapter 12 about whole-body control for humanoid robotics. The chapter covers quadratic programming formulations, hierarchical task prioritization, real-time performance considerations, and ROS 2 integration. The chapter follows the required textbook template with Learning Outcomes, Overview, Key Concepts, Main Content, Code Examples, Summary, and Review Questions. Configuration files were updated to include the new chapter in the website navigation.

## Implementation Details

- Created comprehensive Chapter 12: "Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robotics" (c12-whole-body-control.md)
- Covered quadratic programming (QP) based controllers and hierarchical optimization techniques
- Detailed whole-body control architecture with constraint handling and task prioritization
- Provided complete C++ implementations for whole-body controllers and task management
- Updated navigation configuration files (sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js) to include the new chapter
- Followed textbook template structure with all required sections

## Outcome
Chapter 12 successfully implemented with technical accuracy and educational value for university-level robotics students. The chapter begins Module 4 on Humanoid Integration with advanced whole-body control techniques for humanoid robots.

## Evaluation
- Chapter meets all constitutional requirements (template structure, technical precision, code examples)
- Content aligns with module progression (Whole-body control in Module 4)
- Technical information verified through context7 MCP tool
- Ready for user approval before proceeding to Chapter 13
