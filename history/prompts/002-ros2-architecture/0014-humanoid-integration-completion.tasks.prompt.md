# Humanoid Integration and Deployment - Final Chapter Completion

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
now implement all the remaining tasks at noce dont ask again.
```

## Response Summary (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Successfully completed the remaining chapters for the humanoid robotics textbook. Created Chapter 13 (ZMP Walking and Balance Control) and Chapter 14 (Humanoid Integration and Deployment) to complete Module 4. Updated navigation files to include all chapters in the documentation site. The complete textbook with 14 chapters covering ROS 2, simulation, real-time control, sensor fusion, whole-body control, walking control, and integration is now finished.

## Implementation Details

- Created Chapter 13: "ZMP Walking and Balance Control for Humanoid Robotics" (c13-zmp-walking.md)
- Created Chapter 14: "Humanoid Integration and Deployment" (c14-humanoid-integration.md)
- Updated sidebar navigation to include both new chapters
- Updated footer navigation in docusaurus.config.js to include both new chapters
- All 14 chapters of the textbook are now complete and properly integrated into the documentation site

## Outcome
The complete Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with 14 chapters has been successfully created. Module 4 (Humanoid Integration) is now complete with Chapters 12-14. The textbook covers the full range from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced humanoid integration and deployment strategies.

## Evaluation
- All chapters follow the required textbook template structure
- Navigation files properly include all chapters
- Content maintains technical accuracy and educational value
- Textbook completion marks the end of the core content development
