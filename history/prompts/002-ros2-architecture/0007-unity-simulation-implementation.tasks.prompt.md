# Unity Simulation Implementation for Chapter 7

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
/sp,implement ok great move on the next task.
```

## Response Summary (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Successfully created Chapter 7 about Unity simulation for humanoid robotics. The chapter covers Unity's ECS architecture, URDF import workflows, physics simulation using Unity Physics, and ECS-based control systems for humanoid robots. The chapter follows the required textbook template with Learning Outcomes, Overview, Key Concepts, Main Content, Code Examples, Summary, and Review Questions.

## Implementation Details

- Created comprehensive Chapter 7: "Unity Simulation for Humanoid Robotics" (c7-unity-simulation.md)
- Covered Unity's ECS architecture and its application to robotics
- Detailed URDF import and robot model integration workflows
- Explained physics simulation configuration using Unity Physics
- Provided examples of balance control and inverse kinematics systems
- Included visualization and debugging tools for humanoid development
- Followed textbook template structure with all required sections

## Outcome
Chapter 7 successfully implemented with technical accuracy and educational value for university-level robotics students. The chapter bridges the gap between Isaac Sim (Chapter 6) and advanced simulation techniques, preparing students for Unity-based robotics development workflows.

## Evaluation
- Chapter meets all constitutional requirements (template structure, technical precision, code examples)
- Content aligns with module progression (Simulation environments in Module 2)
- Technical information verified through context7 MCP tool
- Ready for user approval before proceeding to Chapter 8
