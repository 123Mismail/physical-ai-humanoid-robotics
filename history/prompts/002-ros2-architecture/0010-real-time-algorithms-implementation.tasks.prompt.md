# Real-Time Algorithms Implementation for Chapter 10

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
ok great work now go for the next task.
```

## Response Summary (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Successfully created Chapter 10 about real-time control algorithms for humanoid robotics. The chapter covers Model Predictive Control (MPC), whole-body control frameworks, trajectory optimization, and real-time optimization techniques. The chapter follows the required textbook template with Learning Outcomes, Overview, Key Concepts, Main Content, Code Examples, Summary, and Review Questions. Configuration files were updated to include the new chapter in the website navigation.

## Implementation Details

- Created comprehensive Chapter 10: "Real-Time Control Algorithms for Humanoid Robotics" (c10-real-time-algorithms.md)
- Covered Model Predictive Control with Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM)
- Detailed whole-body control framework using quadratic programming
- Explained trajectory optimization with real-time constraints
- Provided real-time optimization techniques including efficient QP solving
- Updated navigation configuration files (sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js) to include the new chapter
- Followed textbook template structure with all required sections

## Outcome
Chapter 10 successfully implemented with technical accuracy and educational value for university-level robotics students. The chapter continues Module 3 on Edge Computing and Embedded Systems with advanced control algorithms for humanoid robots.

## Evaluation
- Chapter meets all constitutional requirements (template structure, technical precision, code examples)
- Content aligns with module progression (Real-time algorithms in Module 3)
- Technical information verified through context7 MCP tool
- Ready for user approval before proceeding to Chapter 11
